4.2.6 Wraase SC-2
A later version of Wraase modes was first built in the newer converter SC-2 from
Wraase Electronics. Again, it provides another variant of line sequential systems.
The author dropped the sequence of colors used in the earlier SC-1 converter, so the
colors are now sent in the order: red – green – blue. Additionally, there is only one
horizontal sync at the beginning of each line, just as in the Scottie and Martin.
Unlike other systems, the RGB system in the SC-2 has one characteristic that
distinguishes it from other conventional modes. Image transfer is achieved when the
transmission time for the green component is equal to the sum of the transmission
time of the red and blue components, i.e. the ratio 2 : 4 : 2 of R : G : B components.
Between color components short gaps are not sent.
As we already know that the human eye is most sensitive to green by more than
50 %. The remaining 50 % in SC-2 is split evenly between the red and blue components. Red and blue components are not processed for a differential signal. This
color reduction is not visible on common pictures, but it may happen that some images (e.g. B&W mosaic) may lose color information. The system is less precise for
color interpretation in comparison with YCrCb modes, but better in tuning resistance. One disadvantage of color reduction is found, when green shadows appears
on the image in stations without precise clock timing.
This mode is preferable in comparison to YCrCb because bad tuning will only
reduce the contrast or saturation, but the hue is not distorted. Occasional green
shadows remain as a tax for reduced transmission time.
The Wraase SC-2 family just like all other systems, also has four different modes.
The SC-2 180 offers best quality for three minute transmission, and unlike the previous modes does not use the RGB ratio 2 : 4 : 2 and is therefore a faster alternative
to the Scottie DX mode. The two-minute SC-2 120 uses the RGB format 2 : 4 : 2.
The remaining two modes, SC-2 30 with 128 and SC-2 60 with 256 lines have about
half of the resolution found in SC-2 120.
